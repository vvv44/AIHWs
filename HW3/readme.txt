by Victor Vargas and Xavier Martinez

The program translates a map from a text file (specified in arguments in the console) and applies a searching Algorithms 
(also specified in command arguments after testing file). The position arguments must be treat as array indices, as such the begin at zero.

**Search Algorithms**
Breadth-First Search - BFS
Iterative Deepening Search - IDS
A* Search - AS

**How to run**
"java -jar searchHW.jar [filename].txt [search-algo]"
Example:
"java -jar searchHW.jar test1.txt IDS"
